Anomaly Detection on MVTec Dataset
This project implements an anomaly detection system using deep learning, specifically designed to work with the MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTec AD) dataset. The goal is to identify defects or anomalies in various industrial objects.

🌟 About the Project
This repository contains the code for training and evaluating an anomaly detection model. The model is trained on "good" (non-anomalous) images and then tested on a mix of "good" and "defective" images to see how well it can distinguish between them. This approach is common in industrial settings where defects are rare and varied.

💾 Dataset
This project uses the MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTec AD) dataset. It is a comprehensive dataset for benchmarking anomaly detection algorithms, containing over 5000 high-resolution images of different object and texture categories.

Training Set: Contains only anomaly-free images.

Test Set: Contains both anomaly-free and anomalous images with various types of defects.

You will need to download the dataset and organize it into Train and Test folders as expected by the mvtec.py script.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
You need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sethu0073/Anomaly_Detection_project.git
cd Anomaly_Detection_project

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:
The project dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage
To run the anomaly detection script, execute the mvtec.py file.

python mvtec.py

The script will handle the data loading, model training, and evaluation process. Make sure your dataset is correctly placed in the Train and Test directories within the project folder.
